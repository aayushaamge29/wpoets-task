1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
Answer - I spent around 8 to 10 hours on the coding test. It took time to properly plan, design the structure, write the code, and test everything.

What would you add if you had more time?
--If I had more time, I would improve a few things:
--Make the code more reusable and cleaner.
--Add image compression or optimization during upload.
--Improve frontend animations and transitions.
--Add more validation and handle edge cases.
--Add a dark/light mode switch for better UI experience.

2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer - Yes, I have faced a few performance issues while working on real projects.
To solve them, I usually:

--Try to reproduce the issue and understand what's slow.
--Check error logs or slow query logs for any warning signs.
--Use tools like Laravel Debugbar to check database queries or loops.
--If needed, I check the server performance using tools like top or htop.
--Then I fix the issue â€” like optimizing queries, adding indexes, or using caching where needed.
